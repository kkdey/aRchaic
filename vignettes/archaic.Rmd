## Introduction 

**aRchaic** is a R/python software environment that performs model based 
clustering and visualization of ancient and modern DNA samples from one or more 
studies. This model can be used to identify distinct patterns of DNA damage and
is capable of reflecting relative rates of contamination in contaminated aDNA
samples. 


Here is a visual representation of **aRchaic** on *moderns*, 
ancient samples treated with UDG library protocol and ancient samples not 
treated with UDG library protocol.

## aRchaic workflow

For every mismatch in a BAM file with respect to a reference genome, **aRchaic**
records the various features of the mismatch - mismatch type, flanking bases,
strand break base, strand and position of mismatch from the ends of read - into 
a .csv file which we call the *Mismatch Feature Format (MFF)* file. 

Next, **aRchaic** fits a mixed membership  model on the mismatch feature data 
that allows each sample to have partial memberships in more than one cluster 
where the clusters represent distinct mismatch feature profiles. 

The cluster memberships from model fit are represented in a stacked bar chart 
grouped by studies (Figure 1 left), while the clusters are represented as logo
plots of enrichment of their mismatch profiles against a modern background
(Figure 1 right).

For example, in Figure 1, Cluster 1 (red) is primarily represented in moderns
and shows no enrichment in mismatch profile with respect to modern 
background. Cluster 2 (blue) is represented mainly in non UDG-ancients, and 
highlghts enrichment of C-to-G mismatches happening at the ends of the reads,
with a depletion of G on right flanking base - due to scarcity of CpG sites in
genome.  Cluster 3 (orange) is represented in UDG ancients and shows enrichment
of C-to-G mismatches at mainly the terminal position of read with further
enrichment of these mismatches at CpG sites.


In the next sections, we present a tutorial on how to generate images  (like in
Figure 1) starting from the BAM files for the samples.

## Installation

First and foremost, the user is required to install 
[python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and 
[R/RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

Next, the user needs to install the Python packages 
[pysam](http://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) and
[pyfaidx](https://pythonhosted.org/pyfaidx/#installation).

Next, start a new R session and install the R dependency libraries.

```{r echo=TRUE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TaddyLab/maptpx")
devtools::install_github("kkdey/CountClust")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("plyr")
source("https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Logolas")
```

Once you have run through the above steps, install the R package **aRchaic**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("kkdey/aRchaic")
```

Finally, load aRchaic into R

```{r}
library(aRchaic)
```

## aRchaic input - MFF file

The **aRchaic** R package requires as input a MismatchFeatureFormat (MFF) file, which is
a special type of .csv formatted file. A typical example MFF file looks like the 
following 

```{r}
mff <- read.csv(system.file("extdata","ancients","NE2_subsampled.csv",package = "aRchaic"), header = FALSE)
head(mff)
```

The first column represents mismatch type and flanking bases :
(left flank base)(mismatch)(right flank base) <-> (A)(C->T)(C).
The second and third columns represent the position of mismatch from 5' and 3' ends
of reads after mapped to reference. The fourth and 5th columns represent the base
1 base upstream from 5' end of read and 1 base downstream from 3' end of read 
respectively. The 6th column contains information of which strand the read comes
from, and the 7th column is an identifier for the read containing the mismatch.

## archaic_prepare()

Suppose you have two folders of MFF files corresponding to two studies - one for moderns
and one for ancients. We incorporate them as part of the R package itself - lets call them
`moderns` and `ancients`.

- **Modern files** :

```{r}
moderns_dir <- system.file("extdata","moderns", package = "aRchaic")
list.files(moderns_dir, pattern = ".csv")
```

- **Ancient files** :

```{r}
ancients_dir <- system.file("extdata","ancients", package = "aRchaic")
list.files(ancients_dir, pattern = ".csv")
```

Each of the folders has 5 MFF files corresponding to 5 samples. 

First we prepare the input data to **aRchaic** model from the above data folders.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
out <- archaic_prepare(dirs = c(moderns_dir, ancients_dir))
```

The output `out` should be a list with 2 elements - corresponding to 2 study 
folders. Each element is a matrix with samples along the rows, coded 
mismatch features along columns, with cells of the matrix recording counts 
of the number of times a coded mismatch pattern occurs in a sample. 

`archaic_prepare` also saves these elements as separate .RData files in each 
study folder, so they can be re-used for similar analysis downstream more easily
without needing to process the MFF files everytime. In fact, if you run

```{r}
out2 <- archaic_prepare(dirs = c(moderns_dir, ancients_dir))
out3 <- archaic_prepare(dirs = moderns_dir)
```

you will see that `out2` or `out3` no longer process the .csv files in the folders
and directly read from the .Rdata file.


## archaic_fit() 

Before modeling and visualization, we choose a directory - `output_dir` -
to save the model output and the visualization.

We fit the mixed membership model in **aRchaic** onthe output from `archaic_prepare()`.
We choose the number of clusters $K=2$

```{r}
output_dir <- system.file("extdata","archaic_results", package = "aRchaic")
model <- archaic_fit(out, K = 2, output_dir = output_dir)
```


Alternatively, one can also input the study folder vector directly into 
`archaic_fit()`.

```{r}
model <- archaic_fit(c(moderns_dir, ancients_dir), K = 2, output_dir = output_dir) 
```

the output `model` consists of 

- **omega** : the grades of membership to be plotted by stacked bar chart
- **theta** : cluster profiles - with each column a probability distribution on
          coded mismatch features 
- **assessment** : assessment of model fit : BIC and loglikelihood


              
## archaic_plot()

The model output, in particular **omega** and **theta** can be visualized using 
the `archaic_plot()` command.

```{r warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
archaic_plot(model, output_dir = output_dir, background = "modern")
```

After running this, go to the output directory `output_dir`. 
You should see there is a `structure.png` file for the stacked bar chart 
representation of the **omega** output from `archaic_fit` and for each 
$k=1,2$, a `logo_clus_k.png` file visualizing the mismatch profile in 
**theta** for each cluster. 
Also notice that the method clearly separates out the example modern samples 
from the ancient samples
